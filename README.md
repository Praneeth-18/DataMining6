## 1. K-Means Clustering from Scratch
Explored the implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique used for partitioning data into distinct groups or clusters. The process involves selecting initial centroids, assigning data points to the nearest centroid, and iteratively refining the centroid positions.

## 2. Hierarchical Clustering
Examined hierarchical clustering, a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Discussed two approaches: Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisive (top-down). Also covered the creation and interpretation of dendrograms for visualizing the clustering process.

## 3. Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering
Investigated Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for clustering, which assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. This method is particularly effective in scenarios where clusters are not spherical or have different variances.

## 4. DBSCAN Clustering Using PyCaret Library
Explored the use of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) via the PyCaret library. DBSCAN is effective for datasets with clusters of varying density and can handle outliers. The process included setting up the PyCaret environment and evaluating the model's performance.

## 5. Anomaly Detection Using PyOD
Discussed anomaly detection using the Python Outlier Detection (PyOD) library. Focused on a specific use case, demonstrating how to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset. PyOD offers various algorithms for this purpose, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Isolation Forest.

## 6. Clustering of Time Series Data Using Pretrained Models
Covered clustering of time series data using embeddings from pretrained models like BERT. The approach involves transforming time series into a suitable format for the model, extracting embeddings, and then applying clustering algorithms to these embeddings.

## 7. Clustering of Documents Using State-of-the-Art LLM Embeddings
Addressed document clustering using advanced embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). This method utilizes the capabilities of models like BERT or GPT-3 to generate meaningful embeddings from textual data, which are then used for clustering documents.

## 8. Clustering with Images Using Image-Based LLM Embeddings
Explored the use of image-based LLM embeddings, like those from CLIP, for clustering images. This involves generating embeddings for images using a pretrained model and then clustering these embeddings to group similar images.

## 9. Audio Embeddings Using Image-Based LLMs
Discussed the generation of audio embeddings using image-based LLMs. This process converts audio to a visual representation (spectrogram) and then uses an LLM to generate embeddings from these spectrograms, which can be used for tasks like clustering or anomaly detection.
